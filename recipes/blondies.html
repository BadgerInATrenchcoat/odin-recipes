        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking powder </li>
            <li>1/8 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 c all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 c chopped walnuts, optional</li>
            <li>1 c brown sugar, firmly packed</li>
            <li>5 Tbsp butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp good vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 c white chocolate chips (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. </li>
            <li>Stir together baking powder, soda, salt, and flour. Sift dry ingredients into a medium bowl, stir in 1/4 cup nuts and set aside.</li>
            <li>In another, larger, bowl mix 1 cup brown sugar and 5 tablespoons melted butter. Combine well. Add eggs and vanilla and mix well, again.</li>
            <li>Stir flour mixture into butter/brown sugar mixture, a little at a time. When well mixed stir in white chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Spread batter evenly in a non-stick 9 inch square pan. This will be a small amount of dough. The pan will not be as full as it would be for typical brownies.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes or until blondies pass the toothpick test. Remove from oven.</li>
        </ol>
